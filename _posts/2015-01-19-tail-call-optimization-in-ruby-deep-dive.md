title: 'Tail Call Optimization in Ruby: Deep Dive'
---
In [my last post](http://blog.tdg5.com/tail-call-optimization-ruby-background/),
I began an exploration of tail call optimization in Ruby with some
[background on tail call optimization and its little known existence and usage
in Ruby](http://blog.tdg5.com/tail-call-optimization-ruby-background/).
In this post, we'll continue that exploration at a much lower level, moving out
of the Ruby layer and descending to whatever depths are necessary to get to the
bottom of how the Ruby VM implements tail call optimization internally.

A lot of what follows wouldn't be possible without [Pat Shaughnessy's Ruby Under
a Microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope) (and a healthy
dose of [K & R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)). If
you find you enjoy the conceptual level of this article and you're interested in
more, I'd highly recommend [Ruby Under a Microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope).
I found it an enjoyable, empowering, fascinating, and approachable introduction
to the internals of Ruby. If you're curious about the book, but you're still
unsure about it, I'd encourage you to check out [Ruby Rogues #146, a book club
episode featuring Ruby Under a Microscope](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/146-rr-book-club-ruby-under-a-microscope-with-pat-shaughnessy)
with guest appearances by the author, [Pat Shaughnessy](http://patshaughnessy.net/),
and [Aaron Patterson](http://tenderlovemaking.com/), of Ruby and Rails fame, and
who also wrote the foreword of the book. It's an enjoyable episode that
definitely helped guide my decision to read the book.

So, getting on to the subject of today's post. Hold on to your butts.

## Revisiting our tail recursive Guinea pig
In [my last post](http://blog.tdg5.com/tail-call-optimization-ruby-background/),
we discovered a tail recursive function in [the Ruby test suite](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/fcf6fa8781fe236a9761ad5d75fa1b87f1afeea2/test/ruby/test_optimization.rb#L213),
which we extracted (with a few tweaks) to demonstrate tail call optimization in
Ruby. We'll need our Guinea pig again for today's exercise, so allow me to
introduce her one more time:

```ruby
code = <<-CODE
  class Factorial
    def self.fact_helper(n, res)
      n == 1 ? res : fact_helper(n - 1, n * res)
    end

    def self.fact(n)
      fact_helper(n, 1)
    end
  end
CODE
options = {
  tailcall_optimization: true,
  trace_instruction: false,
}
RubyVM::InstructionSequence.new(code, nil, nil, nil, options).eval
```

I won't go into the details again, but suffice it to say that this code snippet
will add a **Factorial** class with a tail call optimized **fact** method to our
environment. Our journey begins with this class method.

## Initial descent
With our tail recursive Guinea pig revived, we can begin our descent into the
internals of Ruby's implementation of tail call optimization. A month ago I
wouldn't have known where to begin such a quest, but this is where some of the
background and methods employed in [Ruby Under a Microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope)
will be of great utility.

One method that [Ruby Under a Microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope)
uses to great effect is using [**RubyVM::InstructionSequence#disasm**](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/RubyVM/InstructionSequence.html#method-c-disasm)
to disassemble Ruby code into the underlying YARV instructions that the Ruby VM
will actually execute at runtime. Using this technique we should be able to
disassemble both a tail call optimized version and an unoptimized version of our
**Factorial#fact** method and compare the instruction sequences for differences.

Before we continue, let's rewind for a second and discuss YARV. YARV, which
stands for Yet Another Ruby Virtual Machine, is a stack-oriented VM internal to
Ruby that is responsible for compiling your Ruby code into low-level bytecode
instructions (called YARV instructions) and executing those instructions. YARV
was introduced in Ruby 1.9 to improve performance over Ruby 1.8's direct
traversal and interpretation of the Abstract Syntax Tree generated by parsing a
Ruby program. For more insight into on how Ruby executes your code, you can
check out an excerpt from [Ruby Under a Microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope),
[How Ruby Executes Your Code by Pat Shaughnessy](http://patshaughnessy.net/2012/6/29/how-ruby-executes-your-code).

Back to our regularly scheduled broadcast.

To facilitate comparing the YARV instructions of the tail call optimized and
unoptimized versions of our factorial function, I've tweaked our Guinea pig
script to disassemble both versions of the function and **puts** them to STDOUT.
Here's the resulting script:

```ruby
code = <<-CODE
  class Factorial
    def self.fact_helper(n, res)
      n == 1 ? res : fact_helper(n - 1, n * res)
    end

    def self.fact(n)
      fact_helper(n, 1)
    end
  end
CODE

{
  'unoptimized' => { :tailcall_optimization => false, :trace_instruction => false },
  'tail call optimized' => { :tailcall_optimization => true, :trace_instruction => false },
}.each do |identifier, compile_options|
  instruction_sequence = RubyVM::InstructionSequence.new(code, nil, nil, nil, compile_options)
  puts "#{identifier}:\n#{instruction_sequence.disasm}"
end
```

There are two things here worth making note of. First, I've chosen to disable
the trace instruction for both versions to avoid unnecessary differences between
the two instruction sequences that don't actually pertain to how Ruby implements
tail call optimization internally. Second, though it is not explicit in this
script, I am running MRI Ruby 2.2.0 locally, so all of the YARV instructions and
C code that we'll look at are specific to MRI Ruby 2.2.0 and may be different
from other versions.

You can view [the YARV instructions of the unoptimized Factorial class here](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/60b19663b0c9a34117b47665045ba66679584e14/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/fact_disasm.txt)
and [the YARV instructions of the tail call optimized Factorial class here](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/60b19663b0c9a34117b47665045ba66679584e14/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/fact_tco_disasm.txt).

A vimdiff of the two instruction sequences with changed lines highlighted in
purple and the actual changes highlighted in red looks like so:

[![Differences between the unoptimized Factorial class and the tail call optimized Factorial class](https://tdg5.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tco_diff.jpg)](https://tdg5.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/tco_diff.jpg)

Oh no! Disaster! It seems that our initial descent is some what of a failure.
Other than the addition of a **TAILCALL** flag to a few of the
**opt_send_without_block** instructions, the YARV instructions for both the
unoptimized version and the tail call optimized version are **exactly the
same**. What gives?

From here it seems like our only logical course of action is to descend even
further and look at the C code that makes up those YARV instructions with the
hope that the **TAILCALL** flag is really all that's needed to transform an
unoptimized call into a tail call optimized call.

## Descending into the C
We begin our journey into Ruby's C internals where our YARV instructions left
us, with the **opt_send_without_block** instruction. Hopefully, we can find
something in the implementation of that instruction that will help us find
our way to where Ruby implements tail call optimization internally.

As discussed in [Ruby Under a Microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope),
the definitions that are used during the Ruby build process to generate the C
code for all the YARV instructions live in the Ruby source in [insns.def](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/6c0a375c58e99d1f5f1c9b9754d1bb87f1646f61/insns.def).
With a little grepping, we can find the definition of **opt_send_without_block**
around [line 1047 of insns.def](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/6c0a375c58e99d1f5f1c9b9754d1bb87f1646f61/insns.def#L1047):

```c
DEFINE_INSN
opt_send_without_block
(CALL_INFO ci)
(...)
(VALUE val) // inc += -ci->orig_argc;
{
  ci->argc = ci->orig_argc;
  vm_search_method(ci, ci->recv = TOPN(ci->argc));
  CALL_METHOD(ci);
}
```

As you've almost certainly noticed, this isn't quite C. Rather, during the Ruby
build process this definition is used to generate the actual C code for the
**opt_send_without_block** instruction. [You can view the fully generated C code
for **opt_send_without_block** in all its monstrous glory here](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/2a9e48ccc10082d37c821e3b838f223597a0d7b6/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/opt_send_without_block.vm.inc).

Luckily, for our purposes, we don't have to go quite to that extreme and can
operate at the instruction definition level. One mutation I will make before we
continue is to expand the **CALL_METHOD** macro and remove some noise added to
facilitate the macro. That brings us to the following:

```c
ci->argc = ci->orig_argc;
vm_search_method(ci, ci->recv = TOPN(ci->argc));
VALUE v = (*(ci)->call)(th, GET_CFP(), (ci));
if (v == Qundef) {
  RESTORE_REGS();
  NEXT_INSN();
}
else {
  val = v;
}
```

OK, so what in the name of Neptune is going on here? Well, the first thing to
notice is there's no sign of tail call optimization here, so the question for
now is, where to next?

In this case, the **ci** variable is of most interest to our particular quest.
The **ci** variable references a **rb_call_info_t** struct which encapsulates a
variety of data about a method call including, among other things, the receiver
of the call, how many arguments the call takes, and a reference to the C
function that should actually be executed by the call. It's this final reference,
**ci->call**, that we're most interested in, as we hope to find some trace of
tail call optimization therein.

From the code above we can ascertain that when the Ruby VM executes a method
call, it invokes the function pointed to by the **rb_call_info_t* struct's
**call** field with the current thread (**th**), the current frame pointer
(result of **GET_CFP**), and the **rb_call_info_t** struct itself (**ci**) for
arguments.

This is definitely a step in the right direction, but since we have no insight
into the origins of the function pointed to by the **rb_call_info_t** struct's
**call** pointer, we'll need to step backward before we can step forward.
Luckily for us, we literally only need to take one step backward to the previous
line where **vm_search_method** is invoked.

At this point, rather than drill into every call
that is made on the way to our goal, let's speed things up a bit. We'll still
walk through each step, but we'll be more brief and skip the code snippets
until we get a whiff of tail call optimization. That said, I've collected [the
source for each step of the way from **CALL_METHOD** to the internals of Ruby's
tail call optimization into one file](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c)
for your viewing pleasure.

Take a deep breath...

- The call to [**vm_search_method**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L2)
  is where the value of [**ci->call** is set, and it is set to reference another
  function, **vm_call_general**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L15).

- [**vm_call_general**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L24)
  when called [invokes and returns the result of another method, **vm_call_method**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L26).

- [**vm_call_method**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L31)
  at about 155 lines, is a monster of a function, that handles every type of
  method invocation that the Ruby VM supports. It'd be pretty easy to get lost in
  this method, but we are fortunate in that we know we are dealing with an
  instruction sequence method type because we got to this point from a YARV
  instruction. This allows us to jump right to the portion of the
  switch statement that deals with instruction sequence type methods. In which
  case, [**vm_call_method** returns the result of yet another function invocation **vm_call_iseq_setup**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L45).

(If you're beginning to wonder if this rabbit hole of a descent has a bottom,
don't worry, we're almost there.)

- [**vm_call_iseq_setup**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L210)
  is a two-liner that sets up the callee of the method and then [returns the
  result of another function invocation, **vm_call_iseq_setup_2**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L213).

- [**vm_call_iseq_setup_2**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L218)
  is where we finally get our first whiff of tail call optimization. In fact, the
  only purpose of **vm_call_iseq_setup_2** is to check if tail call optimization
  is enabled and if so [it calls yet another function, **vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L224).

(**So close!** But, while we're here, it's worth noting that normally [when tail
call optimization is not enabled, **vm_call_iseq_setup_2** will call
**vm_call_iseq_setup_normal**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L221)
instead of **vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall**. We'll come back to this alternative
path in a moment.)

- One look at [**vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L252)
  and it's obvious that we've found what we've been searching for, the heart of
  Ruby's support for tail call optimization.

Success! Well, sort of, we still need to grok what's going on here, and come to
think of it, where the hell are we? Let's take a look at what's going on inside
**vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall** and see if we can find our bearings and see how
this call translates into the goodness of tail call optimization.

## Just when you were starting to think it was turtles all the way down
Though we could consider **vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall** on its own, we would
probably do better to use the same strategy that we employed earlier and compare
the unoptimized version to the tail call optimized version, and see what is
different between the two. It didn't work for us last time, but maybe we'll have
better luck this time around.

We've established that the tail optimized version can be found in
**vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall**, and if it wasn't obvious from its name or from
my making a point of mentioning it during our descent, the unoptimized version
can be found in [**vm_call_iseq_setup_normal**](https://github.com/tdg5/blog_snippets/blob/12cb499a95ced517ee9f70febfa9472e2d055d71/lib/blog_snippets/tail_call_optimization_in_ruby_internals/from_call_method_to_tco.c#L221).
Looking at both methods at a high level, it looks like we're still in the
process of making the method call, as both of these functions seem to be
preparing Ruby's internal stack prior to pushing a new frame onto the call
stack.

Here's a side-by-side vimdiff highlighting the differences between the two
functions, though I should warn you that I made a couple of minor adjustments to
**vm_call_iseq_setup_normal** to suppress irrelevant differences:

[![Differences between vm_call_iseq_setup_normal and vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall](http://tdg5.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/vm_call_iseq_setup_diff.jpg)](http://tdg5.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/vm_call_iseq_setup_diff.jpg)

Compared to the extremely minimal differences in the our initial diff, I'm much
more optimistic that we'll find what we're looking for in this larger change
set. Let's start with **vm_call_iseq_setup_normal** since it is the shorter and
more typical of the two functions.

## vm_call_iseq_setup_normal
```c
VALUE *argv = cfp->sp - ci->argc;
```

**vm_call_iseq_setup_normal** begins by creating a pointer to the position on
the stack where the argument vector (**argv**) for the next iteration of the
recursive call begins. This is achieved by taking the current stack frame's
stack pointer (**cfp->sp**) and moving backward down the stack the appropriate
number of elements, as determined by our old friend the call info struct
(**rb_call_info_t**) and its argument count field (**ci->argc**).

```c
rb_iseq_t *iseq = ci->me->def->body.iseq;
```

**vm_call_iseq_setup_normal** then continues by creating a pointer to the
**rb_iseq_t** struct identifying and encapsulating data about the instruction
sequence that will be invoked by this call.

```c
VALUE *sp = argv + iseq->param.size;
```

**vm_call_iseq_setup_normal** next creates a new pointer (**sp**) and points it
to where it calculates the end of the argument vector (**argv**) to be using the
value returned by **iseq->param.size**, a field related to the instruction
sequence indicating how many parameters the instruction sequence takes.

It may seem strange that the VM determines the beginning of **argv** by descending
**ci->argc** elements from the top of the stack and then later finds the end of
**argv** by ascending **iseq->param.size** elements up the stack, however the use
of **iseq->param.size** allows the VM to allocate extra space on the stack in
situations that use special types of arguments. In this case however, our Guinea
pig function uses only simple arguments so **ci->argc** and **iseq->param.size**
are equal. This brings us right back to where we started at the top of the stack.

```c
  for (i = 0; i < iseq->local_size - iseq->param.size; i++) {
    *sp++ = Qnil;
  }
```

This next segment is responsible for allocating and clearing out space on the
stack for local variables and special variables that will be required to execute
the method call. In this case, our Guinea pig function doesn't use any local
variables so no space is needed for those, but the VM does need to allocate a
spot on the stack for special variables. That said, though the VM allocates a
spot on the stack for special variables, our function doesn't actually use any
of Ruby's special variables[^1], so that spot on the stack will remain nil.

```c
vm_push_frame(th, iseq, VM_FRAME_MAGIC_METHOD,
  ci->recv, ci->defined_class, VM_ENVVAL_BLOCK_PTR(ci->blockptr),
  iseq->iseq_encoded + ci->aux.opt_pc, sp, 0, ci->me, iseq->stack_max);
```

For our particular intentions we don't need to get into the nitty-gritty details
of this function invocation, but suffice it to say this call is responsible for
pushing a new frame on to the stack for executing the method call. This new
frame is the next iteration of our recursive function.

```c
cfp->sp = argv - 1 /* recv */;
```

This last bit of logic sets the current frame's stack pointer (**cfp->sp**) to
point to the position on the stack just before the beginning of the argument
vector (**argv - 1**). When this line is executed, that position on the stack is
occupied by the receiver of the next iteration of our function call. This may
seem a little strange, but this assignment is preparing the current stack frame
for when it resumes execution after the completion of the frame we've just
pushed on to the stack. When the current frame resumes, it can assume the
arguments further up the stack have already been consumed and should continue
from further down the stack. Though it's not obvious, we'll see in a minute that
this behavior is important for supporting tail call optimization.

Whew, one down. Now let's take a look at how Ruby handles things differently in
the tail call optimized case.

## vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall

```c
  VALUE *argv = cfp->sp - ci->argc;
  rb_iseq_t *iseq = ci->me->def->body.iseq;
```

**vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall** starts exactly the same as its counterpart: It
creates a pointer to the beginning of the argument vector (**argv**) of the next
iteration of our recursive function and extracts a reference to the instruction
sequence struct from the call info struct.

```c
VALUE *src_argv = argv;
VALUE *sp_orig, *sp;
VALUE finish_flag = VM_FRAME_TYPE_FINISH_P(cfp) ? VM_FRAME_FLAG_FINISH : 0;
```

Though the functions start the same, **vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall** soon
distinguishes itself with the allocation of a number of additional variables.
First, a new pointer (**src_argv**) is created pointing to the beginning of the
argument vector (**argv**). Next, two pointers (**sp_orig** and **sp**) are
allocated, but not assigned. Finally, a fourth variable (**finish_flag**) is
allocated and conditionally assigned.

The final variable, **finish_flag**, is used to allow tail call optimization of
special types of stack frames called **finish frames**. Since we're working with
normal method frames, the **finish_flag** variable can be safely ignored.

```c
cfp = th->cfp = RUBY_VM_PREVIOUS_CONTROL_FRAME(th->cfp);
```

This is where the cleverness of tail call optimization begins to surface.
Whereas the normal recursive strategy continues to accumulate frame after frame,
this line begins to demonstrate how an optimized tail recursive call can avoid
doing so.

The secret sauce behind the success of **vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall**, and tail
call optimization in general, is that each iteration actually removes itself
from the stack, as part of invoking the next iteration. Since the nature of
recursion can make discussion difficult, it's worth taking a moment here for
clarity.

The beginning of **vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall**, places us at the point in the
sequence of events where the current frame, iteration n of
**Factorial.fact_helper**, is preparing the stack for the recursive invocation
of iteration n+1 of **Factorial.fact_helper**. Iteration n, after storing a
reference to the argument vector intended for iteration n+1, pops the current
stack frame (itself) off of the call stack, effectively removing itself from the
stack and giving the appearance that **Factorial.fact** is the call in the stack
before iteration n+1 of **Factorial.fact_helper**.

In terms of another metaphor, if you think of the factorial calculation as
exercise and the call stack as distance traveled, tail call optimization is kind
of like a hamster (or Guinea pig) running on a hamster wheel. Though both the
hamster and the recursive call are running in place, they both still make
progress on the work they are performing. This analogy may also elucidate why
tail recursion can be thought of as a special kind of loop construct.

Returning our focus to **vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall**, after popping the
current frame from the call stack, **vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall** then updates
the thread's current frame pointer (**th->cfp**) and the **cfp** variable to
point at the stack frame prior to the invocation of our tail recursive function,
**Factorial.fact**.

Though this mechanism allows tail call optimization to avoid the stack overflows
inherent to its counterpart, we will see in a moment that it also has other
benefits.

```c
RUBY_VM_CHECK_INTS(th);
```

This line handles a little extra bookkeeping that tail call optimization in Ruby
incurs. Usually, when Ruby switches from one stack frame to another, it takes a
moment to check for pending interrupts. However, since the stack frame was
manually popped off of the call stack, the check for interrupts must also be
handled manually.

```c
sp_orig = sp = cfp->sp;
```

Though it is pretty clear that this line assigns the **sp_orig** and **sp**
variables to the value stored in the current frame's stack pointer (**cfp->sp**)
field, keep in mind that **cfp** now refers to the call to **Factorial.fact**.

As you'll recall from the normal setup function, before the first invocation of
**Factorial.fact_helper**, the previous frame (**Factorial.fact**) would have
rewound it's stack pointer to the position on the stack that it should resume
execution from, which would have been the point on the stack right before the
arguments consumed by the first iteration of **Factorial.fact_helper**. This
behavior benefits tail call optimization in a few ways.

First, because the function call that just ended is exactly the same as the one
that's being set up, it can be assumed that there's enough room on the stack for
the call being prepared. This means that the stack pointer from the call prior
to our tail optimized call (**cfp->sp**) can be used as the starting position
for the new stack (**sp**) thats being assembled.

Second, because the character of the stack is likely consistent for each
recursive call, less overhead is required when setting up the stack. For
example, earlier I mentioned that the Ruby VM allocates a spot on the stack for
special variables that might be used by the function, but that since the
function doesn't use any special variables, that field remains nil. Because of
the alignment of values on stack from iteration to iteration, that nil field is
actually only assigned on the first iteration and on every other iteration the
assignment can be skipped because the value is already nil.

The final benefit that comes from being able to reuse the stack pointer from the
stack frame prior to our tail optimized call (**cfp->sp**) is that that same
pointer also doubles as a pointer to the place on the stack that our current
frame's stack pointer (**cfp->sp**) will need to be rewound later.  To
facilitate this usage a reference is set aside in **sp_orig** for later use.

```c
sp[0] = ci->recv;
sp++;
```

With this line, **vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall** begins to rebuild the stack for
the next iteration of the recursive call. To achieve this, it first pushes the
receiver of the call (**ci-> recv**) into the position at the head of the stack
(**sp[0]**), and increments the stack pointer to the next position.

```c
for (i=0; i < iseq->param.size; i++) {
  *sp++ = src_argv[i];
}
```

Next, the function continues by pushing each of the arguments for the next
iteration onto the stack. This is where it becomes clear why a reference to the
next iteration's argument vector is needed, as the **cfp** pointer was replaced,
and without this reference (**src_argv**) there'd be no consistent means by
which to access those arguments.

This loop is also responsible for the behavior I alluded to above where each
argument is written to a consistent position on the stack with each iteration.


```c
for (i = 0; i < iseq->local_size - iseq->param.size; i++) {
  *sp++ = Qnil;
}
```

Consistent with the normal setup function, the tail call optimized setup function
also reserves and resets additional space on the stack for the method call as
required.

```c
vm_push_frame(th, iseq, VM_FRAME_MAGIC_METHOD | finish_flag,
  ci->recv, ci->defined_class, VM_ENVVAL_BLOCK_PTR(ci->blockptr),
  iseq->iseq_encoded + ci->aux.opt_pc, sp, 0, ci->me, iseq->stack_max);
```

The process of pushing a new frame on to the stack is almost exactly the same as
in the normal setup function, except for one slight difference: The bitwise
logic related to the **finish_flag** variable is added to allow tail call
optimization to be performed on **finish frames** as we briefly discussed
earlier.

```c
cfp->sp = sp_orig;
```

Last but not least, after pushing the new frame on to the stack, the setup
function sets the current frame pointer's stack pointer (**cfp->sp**) to the
point on the stack that it should resume from. In this case, that position
matches the original position of the frame's stack pointer which was tucked away
in **sp_orig** for later use.

At this point we're back in sync with **vm_call_iseq_setup_normal**, but whereas
**vm_call_iseq_setup_normal** would have picked up another stack frame, after
some minor stack shuffling, **vm_call_iseq_setup_tailcall** leaves us right back
where we started, but one step closer to the solution to our factorial
calculation.

## The bends
Wow. I don't know about you, but I didn't expect the bottom to be quite so far
down there. Though I'm eager to come back up for air, as are you I'm sure, it's
worth deferring our ascent a moment to reflect on what we found in the depths.

Ruby's implementation of tail call optimization emerges from the Ruby VM's
stack-oriented nature and ability to discard the current stack frame as it
prepares the next frame for execution. Given this design it becomes more clear
why tail call optimization is handled by Ruby on the C side instead of on the
YARV side since method call setup is below the conceptual level at which YARV
tends to work.

In the end, there's a satirical humor in that we had to go to such depths to
understand the facilities that allow the Ruby VM to handle tail recursive
functions like treading water at the top of the stack.

It's been a long journey, but I hope you learned something along the way, I know
I certainly did. Thanks for reading!
